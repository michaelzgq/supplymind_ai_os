"""
# SupplyMind AI Operating System

SupplyMind is a protocol-based AI system designed to coordinate multiple intelligent agents to automate and optimize workflows in the logistics and supply chain industry. Built with modularity and transparency in mind, the system uses multi-agent orchestration, structured protocols, and open LLMs like Mistral to tackle real-world inefficiencies and reduce uncertainty.

## 🔧 Features
- Multi-agent coordination via MCP v2 protocol
- Pluggable LLMs (starting with Mistral)
- Upload logistics inquiries (Excel, email, natural language)
- Extract cargo information, match quotations, predict delays
- Output PDF/Word recommendation report
- Open-source, community-driven

## 📁 Directory
```
/agents        - Custom modular agents (inquiry, pricing, risk, drafting)
/protocols     - MCP v2 logic and inter-agent communication
/backend       - FastAPI-based coordinator
/frontend      - Streamlit interface for interaction
/data          - Example inquiries and output samples
